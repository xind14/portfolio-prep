## Tell me about yourself

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

1. A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
    - Software Developer
2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
    - In my career, I aspire to blend technical expertise with creativity, aiming to craft innovative solutions that not only meet functional requirements but also resonate with users on a creative and aesthetic level. My goal is to go beyond conventional coding by infusing each project with a sense of artistry.

3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
    - Hi there, I'm Xin, and I'm starting an exciting journey from veterinary clinic team management to the forward-thinking world of software development. While working as a lead receptionist, I honed my multitasking and problem-solving skills. But, I felt stagnant and knew I needed a change to pursue a more fulfilling and stable career path that involved a lot more creativity and impact. I entered this field because it merges creativity with the potentials of technology. But what really motivates me is the opportunity to design user-friendly applications and be a part of pioneering innovations. I excel in environments where collaboration is central, and where progressive ideas come to life. My advantage lies in my background in client-facing roles, where I've come to understand the importance of seamless user interactions. I'm excited to apply this expertise in the tech industry. With strong problem-solving skills and effective communication abilities, I'm looking forward to making a valuable contribution to any software development team.
4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
    - What excites me most about tech is its capacity to serve as a canvas for creativity. In this ever-evolving landscape, the intersection of technology and creativity opens doors to transformative and visually compelling experiences.

## Gather your assets

A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

1. A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
2. A background image, approximately 1500x700 pixels.
3. At least three screenshots of the best-looking parts of a previous project, like your Code 201 final project.
4. At least three screenshots each, of two other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Odd Duck?
